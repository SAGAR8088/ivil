			<h3>IViL - IIT for Villages is a student run organization in IIT Madras(IITM). It serves as a discussion forum and action platform for students of IITM to implement their ideas for Rural India. IViL has a range of projects aimed at impacting rural areas positively, and at learning more about rural life.</h3>
			<h3>We believe that action without deliberation is neither efficient nor effective. We endeavor to foster an environment for intellectual discussion through KnowEx or Knowledge Exchange sessions, rural visits and by thorough documentation of activities

</h3>
<h3>One fine day (in the even semester of 2005) B.Tech students doing a Humanities Department course on “Modern Science in India” at IIT Madras went to a village called Natham, 50 km from Chennai, as a part of their course assignment.</h3>
